Task: Build an Ultimate Calculator in Java
Objective:
Create a console-based calculator in Java that supports basic arithmetic operations and handles all edge cases gracefully. 
The goal is to understand Java syntax, method creation, input handling, and control flow.

Requirements:
1.Create methods for:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division (with zero-check)

2.Use Scanner to take user input for:
Two numbers
Operator (+, -, *, /)

3.Implement a loop to allow multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.
4.Handle edge cases:
Invalid number input
Invalid operator
Division by zero
Graceful exit

5.Welcome to Ultimate Calculator 
Operations: +, -, *, / | Type 'exit' to quit

Enter first number: 100
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): /
Enter second number: 0
 Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
 Result: NaN

Do you want to continue? (yes/no): yes
